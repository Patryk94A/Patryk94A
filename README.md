Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I started my IT journey as a ServiceDesk Agent with Dutch language proficiency. Currently, I provide advanced technical support in Microsoft infrastructure, including Azure, Intune, Microsoft 365, Windows Server, and PowerShell scripting.

Passionate about computers and technology since childhood, I am very proactive and always engaged in side projects. I continuously learn new skills in my free time and share my journey on GitHub. This platform serves as a blog for me, motivating me to keep learning. More complex scripts and projects will be coming soon.

I am seeking a future in the IT industry where I can leverage my expertise and enthusiasm to make a significant impact.
